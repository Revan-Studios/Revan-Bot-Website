# Privacy Policy

Revan does not store any data such as member ID's, Guild ID's, and messages. In the future, there is little to none chance of Revan to collect data, the Revan team also plan on not making a paid subscription to a more "premium" version of our bot due to it going against our morals aswell as the initial idea for this project. We also do not store any message content. In the mind the privacy policy might be changed however for the time being nothing will be changed for a long time.
